## Description
For our MIS 5470: Practical Computing for Data Analytics Course.

We looked to see if we could successfully predict the outcome of Supreme Court Case Rulings using factors and Natural Language processing of the facts statements given by the court.

We performed data wrangling, manipulation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modelling to gain an understanding to generate predictions using a [Supreme Court Cases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/supreme-court-judgment-prediction/data) in order to predict the outcome of major Supreme Court decisions (**first party winner**: the first party being the appellant). 

## Results
![Results](sc_results.png)

The baseline model of assuming no lower court decision reversals is able to predict the first party winner with 64.0% accuracy.

The NLP only Counts-BOW Random Forest outperformed all other tests (marginally) with an accuracy of **66.8%**, being closely followed by the 66.7% logisitic regression missing NLP features and the 66.7% accuracy with TFIDF BOW logistic regression. Several models were able to slightly **outperform** (up to 2.8%).

Thus, it can be shown that modeling using Facts Statements of Supreme Court Cases provides insights towards voting of SCOTUS cases with improved metrics as opposed by the simple assumption of party-dominated voting.
