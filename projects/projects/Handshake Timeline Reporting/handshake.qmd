## Introduction

A script that uses data from Handshake reports to create a Timeline of all student engagements from 2019-present. With this timeline, the user has the ability to generate several other reports.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This script only generates csv files with the data of each report contained. If you need these reports in a better format (Google Sheets), that will have to be done separately.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For the script to function, the configuration must be set properly.

See [Setup](#setup) for the necessary setup for these scripts to run automatically.

## Features

This script can currently create a timeline and 3 different types of reports based on a user-defined config file.

- [x] Report timeline of all student interactions including (Applications, Appointments, Events, Career Fairs, and Logins) from 2019-Present.
- [x] Report student engagements following CLDC appointments.
- [x] Report student engagements following COM1100 presentations.
- [x] Report student engagements vs. their FDS outcomes.

### Generated Report Types

All producable reports are delivered in three types of formats: 

> **Timeline:** Creates a timeline of student identifiers with their engagement types and dates.
>
>   | Student_ID      | Descriptive Information... | Event_Type      | Date     |
>   |-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------|
>   | 000001          | ...                        | Logins          | 20240101 |
>   | 000001          | ...                        | Career_Fairs    | 20240103 |
>   | 000002          | ...                        | Appointments    | 20250102 |

> **Aggregate:** Balances student identifier and descriptive information with timeline aggregate counts.
>
>   | Student_ID      | Descriptive Information... | Total {Engagement Types}  |
>   |-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
>   | 000001          | ...                        | 1 | 5 | 7 | 3 | 10        |
>   | 000002          | ...                        | 2 | 6 | 4 | 5 | 11        |
>   | 000003          | ...                        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 6         |

> * **Melted:** Takes the aggregated report and melts it for use in different visualization softwares.
>
>   | Student_ID      | Descriptive Information... | Event_Type  | Count | Year      |
>   |-----------------|----------------------------|-------------|-------|-----------|
>   | 000001          | ...                        | Logins      | 10    | Freshman  |
