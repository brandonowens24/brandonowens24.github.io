    "text": "Description\nShotQuality is a cutting-edge basketball data company that leverages AI and computer vision to extract precise location data from video feeds for any shot. Our data is trusted by top NCAA teams and sportsbooks to gain a competitive edge. We are excited to offer you an exclusive glimpse into our NCAAM player tracking data, which is used to analyze player and team performance. ShotQuality is the first company to provide player tracking data in all of NCAAM.\n3PT defense has been notoriously difficult to predict on a game-by-game basis and is often plagued by significant noise from season to season, especially in NCAAM. While outliers like Houston have consistently ranked in the top 15 for defensive 3PT% over the past six seasons, the factors that contribute to effective 3PT defense remain largely elusive. Traditionally, 3PT defense has been attributed to a mix of luck, defensive scheme, and player ability. However, in the era of box score statistics, accurately measuring scheme and ability was impossible, leaving luck as the default explanation.\nWe are challenging you to quantify the scheme and ability components that lead to the lowest 3PT% on individual shots. In this year’s Kaggle competition, we invite data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and statisticians to explore the intricate in-game contexts that contribute to effective 3PT defense. We aim to understand the impact of defensive and offensive movements using tracking data, including x/y coordinates of all 10 players in the broadcast view, captured up to 4 seconds before the shot attempt and 2 seconds after (180 frames in total) to predict 3PT shots.\nParticipants will be provided with a full month of tracking data to predict the outcome of individual 3PT shots. We encourage you to think creatively, embrace innovative methodologies, and join us in redefining the analysis of 3PT shots. May the most insightful model win!"

The location data includes the on-court location of each player, along with an indicator to show whether the player is the shooter, an offensive player, or a defensive player.\nNote that all shots in the train or test set are misses that are rebounded by the offensive or defensive team. A shot is from the coordinates where annotation_code == “s” in train_locs.csv and test_locs.csv.\nCoordinates for key locations on the court are (position | x,y)"

    "text": "The Data\nThe dataset utilized within this project was taken from Nishaan Amin’s March Madness Data dataset on Kaggle. Of the numerous tables provided, only the Heat Check Tournament Index and KenPom Barttorvik csvs were taken. The Heat Check Tournament Index dataset is composed of March Madness data after tournament seeding has been conducted, but before any games have been played. Relevant information includes POWER and PATH – referencing a power rating of each team and a rating of the difficulty of their path to the championship, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the KenPom Barttorvik dataset includes the following relevant information KADJ.O (adjusted offense rating), KADJ.D (adjusted defensive rating), BARTHAG (projected win percentage against average D1 team at a neutral site), WIN. (win percentage), FTR (rate of possessions resulting in free throws), TOV. (rate of possessions resulting in turnovers on offense), TOV.D (rate of possessions resulting in turnovers on defense), OREB. (rate of second missed shots resulting in offensive rebounds, DREB. (rate of missed shots resulting in defensive rebounds), X3PT. (three point field goal percentage), X3PT.D (three point field goal percentage against defense), AST. (rate of possessions resultant of an assist), EXP (rating of a team’s experience), and ELITE.SOS (rating of a team’s strength of schedule).\nThese datasets were merged in R on the identifiers YEAR, TEAM.NO, TEAM, SEED, ROUND. After merging, all null values were omitted from the dataset and only the desired columns were taken. This resulted in a new dataset of 640 observations with 20 total variables (17 explanatory variables, 2 identifier variables, and 1 target variable). The target variable/observation of interest was WINS – which means the number of wins a team had in the tournament. For example, if a team lost their first game and was eliminated, they would have 0 WINS. At the same time, a team with 6 WINS equates to the national champion for that year with wins in the round of 64, 32, Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final 4, and the championship."

    "text": "The Process\nAfter importing the data to SAS, the 640 observations were split with a sample rate of 95%. This left 32 observations to be excluded on the dataset – not for testing, but instead to use as an example of future prediction intervals. With these other 608 observations, a linear model was regressed where different metrics and plots were recorded, such as RSQUARE, ADJRSQ, AIC, SBC, PRESS, and residual plots. Each of the metrics performed poorly (0.3943, 0.3769, 75.0403, 154.423, 687.903, respectively) and the fit diagnostics demonstrated non-constant error variance and non-independence of errors for many of the predictor variables. Additionally, many of the explanatory variables appeared non-significant by their respective Fisher tests. Thus, the first focus was on multicollinearity. Variance Inflation Factors were calculated (and removed if larger than 10) and two of the metrics: KADJ_O, KADJ_D, were combined. The resulting variables were WIN_, FTR, TOV_, TOV_D, OREB_, DREB_, X3PT_, X3PT_D, AST_, EXP, PATH, ELITE_SOS, and KADJ_COMB.\nNext, to further improve this model it was beneficial to address heteroscedasticity and assume constant error variance by regressing the model on Weighted Least Squares. The weight equation was taken calculating the inverse of the residuals due to the fact that the original model had many outliers. After doing so, the diagnostic metrics had significantly improved (RSQUARE, ADJRSQ, AIC, SBC, PRESS equal to 0.73639, 0.73062, -100.374, -38.6314, and 503.535, respectively). Additionally, the diagnostic plots appeared to significantly improve upon the previous non-constancy of error variance. The next step was to determine which variables were significantly interacting with one another and contributing to the model. Thus, the best models according to ADJRSQ, CP, and Forward Stepwise Regression were considered. Although all three metrics proposed different “best” models, the same first 10 variables were provided in the ADJRSQ top 3, the CP top 3, and showed significant F values in the Stepwise regression. Thus, the relevant predictor variables included: WIN_, FTR, TOV_D, DREB_, X3PT_D, AST_, EXP, PATH, ELITE_SOS, and KADJ_COMB. This proved to be the best model with exceptional fit diagnostics and a reasonable number of parameters. The final RSQUARE, ADJRSQ, MSE, and parameter estimates are shown:\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Plots\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Plots\n\n\nFinally, the 32 observations not included on the dataset were brought back in using the calculated beta values, the standard error, and a t-distribution value of 95% to calculate the prediction intervals for these unseen cases."

While our refined model successfully takes the raw data and outputs criteria indicative of a good model (ADJRSQ, RSQUARE, AIC, SBC, PRESS, CP), it would still most likely take a miracle to successfully simulate upcoming tournament outcomes. From our 32 additional observations, the model tends to under project wins. This is most likely a symptom of the fact that the majority of teams do not win a single game and that “Cinderella” picks are hard to come by. Thus, the calculation of prediction intervals helps paint a better picture of the range of wins a team may accomplish. Further analysis should be conducted to possibly standardize input and target variables to calculate which factors are the most significant as well and oversample the teams with a larger number of tournament wins."

    "section": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nEvery four years the United States Presidential Election sweeps the nation to discover who will be the country’s new Chief Executive. Although the U.S. is a democratic country, it is subject to a unique system known as the Electoral College. In simple terms, candidates compete in each state (and the capital region) by popular vote to obtain that state’s specific number of electoral votes that is determined by its population. Therefore, some states are worth more than other states for candidates to win and requires strategic campaigning of specific states to obtain enough electoral votes to be the victor. Because this system is unique, predicting who will win the Presidency is no easy task – simple polling of the general public does not clearly paint a picture of who is favored because the overall popular vote means nothing.\nThe election of 2016 is particularly interesting because the two lead candidates (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) were extremely polarizing and led to unique voting patterns. Voters seemed to either aggressively align with one of the two major parties, would vote to choose the lesser of the two polarizing figures, or settle voting on a smaller party candidate. To display just how difficult prediction was during this pattern, major polling sources like FiveThreeEight, the Upshot, 270toWin, the Princeton Election Consortium, the Associated Press, and many other sources incorrectly predicted that Hillary Clinton would be victorious."

    "section": "METHODS",
    "text": "METHODS\nThis analysis was centered from Nate Silver’s:FiveThirtyEight “2016 Election Polls” dataset on Kaggle and eventually paired with David Ward’s “US Electoral College Votes Per State 1788-2020” on Kaggle for Electoral Voting attributes. All data collected was from national polls conducted from November 2015 to November 2016 – the year leading up to the election. Only data with raw polling data with credible polling grades of “B” or above were considered by the analysis. It was assumed that participants would not change their minds from the time of the poll and that each poll maintained a solid spread of each state’s constituency. Additionally, because of the lack of diversity in the Presidency’s usual party, only the two major parties were considered (Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton). Multi-region polls from the same state were condensed and all national polls that took results from a national census that was not state specific were excluded. Additionally, each candidate was assumed to have a normal prior distribution of backing from the polls as well as a normal likelihood for being voted for by voters in that state.\nWith similar idea to Brittany Alexander’s Bayesian Model for the Prediction of the U.S. Presidential Elections, the 2016 election was analyzed using each state’s conjugate normal prior distribution was taken from a specific region of the United States that the state fell into that excluded their own state. This assumes that states in similar geographical areas tend to exhibit similar voting patterns. The regions were separated according to the following image:\n\n\n\nVivid Maps Regioning\n\n\nWhere, for instance, if Texas was taken, the prior mean and variance would be taken from the samples of the rest of the Southwest Region (Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma). Because mean and variance are known, our normal conjugate prior would be:\n\n\n\nPrior\n\n\nAnd the normal likelihood function would be:\n\n\n\nLikelihood\n\n\nThus, with a normal likelihood and a normal prior, our conjugate normal posterior for several observations of y, would be modeled by:\n\n\n\nPosterior\n\n\nAfter the data was cleaned and normalized between the two primary candidates, a posterior distribution for each candidate in each state was generated by 10,000 simulated values and was plotted using RStudio. From these 10,000 simulated values, 1,000 values were randomly drawn, normalized, and then used to predict the percent of the vote each candidate received from the election for each state. These simulations then were used to predict a singular outcome by counting if one candidate received over 500 decisions of the 1,000 samples. The winner of each state was then awarded that state’s electoral college votes to predict who would win the 2016 Presidential Election by having a greater sum of votes. Complete accuracy of the simulations was also recorded on a simulation by simulation basis."

    "text": "RESULTS/DISCUSSION\nFrom the 10,000 posterior draws for each state for each candidate, the total accuracy of the voting outcome on a sample by sample basis turned out to be 86.5% – which when aggregated into singular state votes lowered just slightly to 86.2% and resulted in the following electoral college voting simulation:\n\n\n\nElection Simulation Results\n\n\nThe predicted model struggled significantly in the “Great Lakes”/”Mideast” region which coincidentally lies in many swing states from this election: meaning that these states were battlegrounds that resulted in a difficult and polarized consensus on how constituents would vote. Some swing states like Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Virginia were predicted correctly; however, others like Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina were not. Thus, while the model had a high accuracy rate of 86.2% it ultimately struggled to predict swing states in the Midwest United States. Future analyses would be wise to make several changes with this information. First, as mentioned, obtaining different prior distributions due to the volatility of swing states may have been useful. Additionally, accounting for all major candidates (Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson, and Evan McMullin) was ignored and while the two major parties dominated, according to FiveThreeEight, Gary Johnson was predicted to command about 5.0% of the popular vote. Normalizing candidates may have harmed this distribution as it is not known how pollees would vote if they had to choose for a candidate other than Johnson. Lastly, utilizing poll data from FiveThreeEight may have also been misinformed. While the organization is well known for their election forecasts, they also incorrectly predicted the outcome of the election.\nPosterior distributions for each state for both candidates are shown in the appendix. Hillary Clinton’s distribution is blue, Donald Trump’s distribution is red. For personal observation or reproduction, all code for analysis has been stored inside of brandonowens24’s GitHub repository labeled: “Simple Bayesian Inference on Electoral College Voting”."

With the desired names and ids, plot information was scraped from the OMBD API. This resulted in ~1.02 million movies and ~170k shows in my dataset.\nI then processed the information to get a training corpus. This involved dropping missing columns such as “Title”, “Plot”, “Genre”, “Type”, and “Director”, dropping “Title” duplicates, filtering for origin country to be “United States” or “Japan” or the filtered original language being “English”. My features were then created from a column I named “Description” that fused together the genre, type, director, plot, and keywords for each movie/show. The format looked something like: “A {x[‘Genre’]} {x[‘Type’]} directed by {x[‘Director’]} with keywords consisting of {x[‘keywords’]}. {x[‘Plot’]}”`. This left me with ~200k movies and ~20k shows. I then tokenized these descriptions, lowercasing and removing punctuation.\nI tried a purely NLP approach – no other features were encoded besides these descriptions. Because of the timeline for getting this project in, I didn’t have the time to incorporate other features or test compared to pre-trained word embeddings. This may have been slightly problematic because it creates a bias and dependency on how well the movie’s “full” plot description captures the information of the movie. Perhaps some movies or shows give less information to create mystery and interest and perhaps some writers are just bad at summarization tasks.\nI then took these corpora and applied them separately to 3 different models with different similarity metrics:\n\nModels\n\nWord2Vec Count: Trained movie/show corpus on Gensim’s Word2Vec. In order to get the document embedding, the word vectors for the description are averaged.\nWord2Vec TFIDF: Trained movie/show corpus on Gensim’s Word2Vec.

    "text": "What Are We Looking At?\nMany of these rule changes have caused significant controversy over the last handful of seasons (just check Twitter). With this divide, many fans believe that the league is taking the fun out of the game by limiting exciting plays through the elimination of violence and contact. Using prior information from the 2009-2013 seasons, we inform multiple models (beta congjugate, dirichlet conjugate, and another beta conjugate model) to gain insight on whether protocols set by the NFL to reduce player injury are successful or not over the last 10 years."

    "section": "Findings",
    "text": "Findings\n\n\n\nPosterior Distribution\n\n\nUtilizing a Beta Conjugate Posterior model, the most massive of the posterior distribution shifts comes in 2016, where previously the distributions greatly reflected the prior. With this large shift, it is hard to tell if one rule specifically caused the change (clipping/kickoff format), both rules together did, or with the new rules, there was a crackdown on officiating. This change could also have been caused by unforseen factors, like age.\n\n\n\nPosterior Distribution 2\n\n\nAmid speculation that age is an unforseen factor (perhaps there is a greater proportion of older, more injury prone players present in the league), we utilize a Dirichlet Conjugate Posterior Distribution for four different age bins to gain insight on what distributions of ages occupy the NFL. It is discovered that the percent makeup of 30+ year olds in the league remains around a constant theta distribution; however, the number of 20-24 year olds and 25-29 year olds seams to shift and then realign with the start of the decade.\n\n\n\nPosterior Distribution 3\n\n\nBecause of the slight change in 20-24 year old distribution, we decide to check on the percentage of players that get hurt compared to all players present that are that age. The results are pretty alarming and display that athletes from 20-24 years old have a much more likely chance of becoming injured. Whether this is due load management, increased volume compared to older players, the verocity of a new, intense league, newer sports science training that has progressed explosive movement too fast, or other reasons, it is unclear.\nWhat is clear from these findings is that if the NFL would like to continue their reduction in player injuries, it may be beneficial to commit resources, analysis, and procedure into preventing younger players from getting injured as they have been able to limit the percent chance of older players getting hurt. In further, from our three posterior distribution functions and many other exploratory data wranglings and visualizations, we are able to demonstrate that there has been a definite shift in the injury rate in the NFL in the last 10 years for the better. While it seems like injuries to younger players have gotten worse and the influx of younger athletes has swung, the injury likelihood for older athletes has significantly dropped. This demonstrates that age is a factor for players getting injured, but doesn’t quite explain the dropoff of injury rate within the league. Other factors should be explored to fully assert the claim that NFL rules are indeed reducing injury likelihood amongst athletes. Meanwhile, the findings from this analysis have demonstrates a need for better rehabiliation, therapy, and training methods for younger athletes entering the NFL."

Several models were able to slightly outperform (up to 2.8%).\nThus, it can be shown that modeling using Facts Statements of Supreme Court Cases provides insights towards voting of SCOTUS cases with improved metrics as opposed by the simple assumption of party-dominated voting."

    "text": "The main goal of this competency report is to evaluate a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach using game data from the 2024–2025 NFL regular season. We develop and analyze a Bayesian hierarchical count regression model to estimate team strengths and predict scoring outcomes in the context of the NFL Playoffs for the aforementioned season. Offensive and defensive abilities are modeled separately, allowing for a flexible representation of team performance. To capture the uncertainty within game outcomes, Monte Carlo simulations are employed, generating predictive distributions for playoff matchups and point differentials. Although profitability proved to be extremely variable due to the small sample size of the playoffs, the analysis demonstrates how hierarchical modeling and simulation can formalize betting evaluations in highly liquid markets. By integrating statistical modeling with simulation-based inference and decision-making frameworks, this competency report contributes to the growing literature on sports analytics, as well as demonstrating the practical evaluation of betting strategies in professional retail sports markets."
